# facial-emotion-detection
Developed a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system to classify emotions from images or real-time video.
Utilized OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras for facial detection and emotion classification.
Trained the model on a large dataset of facial expressions to recognize emotions like happy, sad, angry, and neutral.
Implemented a GUI/web interface using Flask/Tkinter to make the system interactive.
Optimized the modelâ€™s accuracy using CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or custom CNN models).
Ensured real-time prediction performance for fast emotion recognition.
